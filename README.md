# AICodeOptimizer

## Description

A neural architecture search framework leveraging Bayesian optimization and graph-based neural networks, enabling efficient discovery of optimal deep learning models for computer vision tasks.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for the AICodeOptimizer software project:
- "Analyzes code performance bottlenecks using dynamic tracing and call graph analysis",
- "Applies AIdriven code refactoring suggestions based on machine learning models trained on opensource codebases",
- "Optimizes memory allocation patterns using garbage collection simulation and heap visualization",
- "Provides realtime code quality metrics and recommendations for improvement using static code analysis",
- "Supports automated code parallelization for multicore processors using dependency graph analysis",
- "Includes integrated debugging tools with AIassisted error detection and root cause analysis",
- "Offers customizable code optimization profiles for different programming languages and runtime environments"
- Let me know if you'd like me to generate more!
